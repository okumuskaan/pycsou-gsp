Theory of Graph Signal Processing
=================================

Graph signal processing is a field where classical signal processing methods developed in the Euclidean domain have been generalised to irregular non-Euclidean domains such as graphs.

    **1. Graph Theory**
    
    Study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects.
    
    **2. Spectral Graph Theory**
    
    Study of the properties of a graph in relationship to the characteristic polynomial, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices associated with the graph, such as its adjacency matrix or Laplacian matrix.

    **3. Graph Signal Calculus**
    
    Study of change of the signals in the same way that geometry is study of graph shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations on graph domains.
    
    **4. Graph Fourier Transform**
    
    Definition of Fourier transform for graph signals and graph spectral domain.
    
    **5. Generalized Operators for Graph Signals**
    
    Study of generic operators of classical signal processing on graph signal processing.
    
    **6. Efficient Filtering on Graph Signals**
    
    Study of computationally more efficient implementation of graph signal filtering.

    **7. Graph Wavelet Theory**

    Definition and methods of wavelet transforms on graph signals.
