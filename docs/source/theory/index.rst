Theory of Graph Signal Processing
=================================

Graph signal processing is a field where classical signal processing methods developed in the Euclidean domain have been generalised to irregular non-Euclidean domains such as graphs.

    **1. Graph Theory**
    
    Study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects.
    
    **2. Spectral Graph Theory**
    
    Study of the properties of a graph in relationship to the characteristic polynomial, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices associated with the graph, such as its adjacency matrix or Laplacian matrix.

    **3. Graph Signals**
    
    **4. Graph Fourier Transform**
    
    **5. Generalized Operators for Graph Signals**
    
    **6. Efficient Filtering on Graph Signals**

    **7. Graph Wavelet Theory**
